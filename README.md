# Python_dungeon

A dungeon text game using Python programming. A personal challenge and practice exercise.
The object is to move your "Player" across the map using arrow keys until it reaches the exit space. If Player meets monster, you lose. If Player finds exit, you win.
A hint will be given if Player is one adjacent space from hitting the Monster, so a bit of basic skill is involved.

The map can be scaled by adjusting the column array and row length in the initializer part of the code.

This challenge uses tkinter module
